# CSML1000-Assignment-2
Assignment #2, Group 8, York University CSML1000, Machine Learning in the Business Context, Fall 2019

Unsupervised Learning assignment, we use behavioural data on credit card customers to classify their usage patterns in order to gain insights that can be used to target specific customers with custom advertising campaigns.

This was a group project, our group repo for the first assignment was a sprawling mess, so I volunteers to host this one. Also helped me with my familiarity with Git.
